# Writing good documentation

## Step 1 - Using Codeblocks

A *good* **cloud engineer** uses codeblocks whenever possible because it allows others to copy and paste their code to replicate or research issues. 

Codeblocks are created with three back ticks **`** (not single quotation) 

```
print("Hello, World!")
```
Highlight syntax by adding the language behind the back ticks
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
